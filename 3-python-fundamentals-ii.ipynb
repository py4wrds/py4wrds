    "  * If you've already written some code to read data from Snowflake, there's no need to re-write that every time in your code that needs snowflake data. Be kind to yourself, make a `read_from_snowflake` function!\n",
    "  * There's no need to force it though. Sometimes it makes sense to copy and modify code, rather than trying to write a single function that handles two slightly different situations.\n",
    "* When consistency is needed.\n",
    "  * There are two different definitions of the [acre-foot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre-foot) unit. By using our `acre_feet_to_m3` function instead of dividing by 1,233.4892 throughout your code, we can ensure that all parts of our program are using a consistent definition of the unit.\n",
    "  * The [Mars Climate Orbiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter#Cause_of_failure) failed because NASA's calculations were in metric units while Lockheed Martin used US units. If the manufacturers had used a shared library of unit conversion functions, perhaps the orbiter would have made it to orbit!\n",
    "* To structure a program.\n",
    "  * You can use functions to split up your program so that it reads almost like English.\n",
    "  * A good guideline: all lines of a function should fit on a computer screen.\n",
    "  * For example, the top-level of this flow rate forecasting program is split into 7 high-level functions: \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def forecast_flow_rate(streamgage_id, forecast_date):\n",
