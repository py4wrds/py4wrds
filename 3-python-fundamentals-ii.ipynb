By using our `acre_feet_to_m3` function instead of dividing by 1,233.4892 throughout your code, we can ensure that all parts of our program are using a consistent definition of the unit.\n",
    "* To structure a program.\n",
    "  * You can use functions to split up your program so that it reads almost like English.\n",
    "  * Good rules of thumb: all lines of a function should fit on a computer screen.\n",
    "  * For example, the top-level of this flow rate forecasting program is split into 7 high-level functions: \n",
