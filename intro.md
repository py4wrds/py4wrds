## Learning objectives

- Master common commands, data types, and data dictionaries.
- Establish best coding practices for managing data and scripts. 
- Master "if/else" statements "for" and "while" loops, and other conditional statements. 
- Write clear functions and documentation to keep code clean and organized. 
- Modularize and disseminate clean codes to facilitate integration and re use with other projects. 
- Analyze model error metrics against observed data. 
- Understand and exploit object-oriented programming. 
- Work with key packages including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, jupyter, etc. 
- Set up and navigate Python integrated development environments such as Jupyter Notebook/Lab, Spyder, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc 
- Create, run, and disseminate virtual conda environments. 
- Use packages like Numpy, matplotlib, hydrostats, and Pulp for linear programming and matrix multiplication, specifically to optimize water allocations using DWRAT. 
- Develop plots and clear visualizations. 
- Use Jupyter Notebooks or other markdown tools to seamlessly embed Python code with documentation and publish it. 
- Use Git and GitHub for backing up code and collaboration with colleagues
