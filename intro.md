# Python for Water Resources Data Science

Welcome to the py4wrds course material!

## About the py4wrds course

This course is most relevant for folks who work with data, no matter their role. You'll learn about fundamentals of Python and software development, and gain practice in using these skills for data science in the water resources domain.

## Learning objectives

- Master common commands, data types, and data dictionaries.
- Establish best coding practices for managing data and scripts. 
- Master "if/else" statements "for" and "while" loops, and other conditional statements. 
- Write clear functions and documentation to keep code clean and organized. 
- Modularize and disseminate clean codes to facilitate integration and re use with other projects. 
- Analyze model error metrics against observed data. 
- Understand and exploit object-oriented programming. 
- Work with key packages including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, jupyter, etc. 
- Set up and navigate Python integrated development environments such as Jupyter Notebook/Lab, Spyder, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc 
- Create, run, and disseminate virtual conda environments. 
- Use packages like Numpy, matplotlib, and other scientific Python tools for data analysis and visualization. 
- Develop plots and clear visualizations. 
- Use Jupyter Notebooks or other markdown tools to seamlessly embed Python code with documentation and publish it.
