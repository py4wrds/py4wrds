    "## Step 1: Install VS Code\n",
    "\n",
    "VS Code (Visual Studio Code) is the development environment we'll be using for the course. It can edit Python files and notebooks, and comes with a number of tools to streamline Python software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Go to the [VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and download the installer for Windows. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Double click the `.exe` file you downloaded to run the installer.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * You can accept all the default options in the install process.\n",

    "\n",
    "VS Code comes with core functionality, but there are a few extra extensions we'll be relying on for the course.\n",

    "  ![extensions](img/0-vscode-extension-icon.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Search for and install the following extensions (all are authored by ![microsoft](img/0-vscode-ms-logo.png)):\n",

    "\n",
    "Conda (Anaconda) is a tool for managing Python dependencies. It was created to make it easy to install scientific computing Python packages.\n",

    "* Go to the [conda website](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success) and download the Windows installer.\n",

    "\n",
    "    * You can accept all the default options, including \"Install for just me\".\n",

    "Ok, lets try it out! From the Start menu, launch **Anaconda PowerShell Prompt**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The logo looks like this: ![anaconda](img/0-anaconda-ps-icon.png)\n",
    "* Conda also installs **Anaconda Prompt**. We won't be using the plain prompt for this course, as the PowerShell version has more features and is more user friendly.\n",
    "* No worries if you're new to conda or the command line: try to follow along for now, we'll cover these topics properly in the first lesson.\n",
    "* Inside the prompt, type `conda --help` then press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>. You should see a list of commands like this, indicating a successful install of conda:\n",

    "## Step 4: Configure Conda\n",
    "\n",
    "We put together a conda environment that contains all the Python packages and remaining software needed for the workshop. You can also use this environment for your own data science projects!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a folder called `py4wrds`. You can do all course-related development inside this folder.\n",
    "* Download this [environment.yml](https://github.com/py4wrds/py4wrds/raw/refs/heads/develop/environment.yml) file into your new `py4wrds` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ````{warning}\n",
    "  The conda environment may change slightly while the course is being developed, as we refine our dependencies and bring you the latest software updates!\n",

    "  ```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* Type `conda env create --file environment.yml` and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>. You should see a loading message like \"Collecting package metadata\"\n",
    "    * It can take over 30 minutes to install the full environment! Luckily this only has to be done once, and adding new packages in the future will be much faster. \n",

    "* From now on whenever we launch the conda prompt, you should run the command `conda activate py4wrds` to switch to your new environment with all your data science Python tools. After running this command, you should see the text at the start of each new line change from `(base)` to `(py4wrds)`. This indicates the active environment.\n",
